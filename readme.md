Components for Pine

Right now this is basically a port of Bootstrap to Pine, but here are some other places to look:

- [React Restart](https://github.com/react-restart/ui) is a good place to look.
- [Shoelace](https://shoelace.style) looks much nicer than Bootstrap (imo), which might be good to copy as well if we start implementing a more complete UI library.
